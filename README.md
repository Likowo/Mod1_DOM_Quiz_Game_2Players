# Mod1_DOM_Quiz_Game_2Players
This is a quiz app game called FES-B ( FrontEnd-Stack Basics) in construction.It will require two players from the traditional one plaer format.
With this app, players can have fun while testing their knowledge of HTML,CSS and javascript.
Two players will take turns answering a set of 5 questions each. You got 15seconds per question.
Note, you cannot change your answer, ones selected.
Player with highest points wins the first round. Players have the option to continue to the next round.
Player with highest points after round two wins the game.
I am using a source code editor called,Visual Studio Code (VS code). You can download and install a free version on to your pc.
This developer tool is powerful. You can complete the entire development cycle in one place using just VS code.Including,writing,editting,debuging,building code and deploying your app.
Ride on with me as I work on this challenging but exciting  project.
